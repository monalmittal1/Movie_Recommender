## Algorithm to recommend movies
The application uses Cosine Similarity which is a scale of similarity from 0 to 1, where 1 denotes 100% similar and 0 denotes completely different. The algorithm uses the name of the movie, genres list , the cast list and the director's name to make the recommendations for similar movies.
